        <b>NB: <br></b>Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms.  Always call before visiting
            your doctor or health facility. People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should
                manage their symptoms at home. <br>On average it takes 5â€“6 days from when someone
                is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.
